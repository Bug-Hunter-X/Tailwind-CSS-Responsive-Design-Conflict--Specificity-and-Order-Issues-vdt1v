The solution involves understanding Tailwind's class precedence and using more specific classes or overriding styles with `!important` (as a last resort).  Ensure that your responsive modifier classes are correctly applied and that they don't conflict with other classes with higher specificity.  Proper ordering of classes from most to least specific can also resolve the issue. In this case, it may involve reorganizing classes to ensure that specific responsive styles override more general styles. Consider using Tailwind's `@apply` directive or creating custom CSS classes for particularly complex responsive layouts.
